I'm a staff urologist at the Portland VA Medical Center. I am originally from Beaverton, OR then went to college at Emory University and completed medical school at Columbia University in New York City.

I'm interested in research, teaching/mentoring, and clinical care. Previous projects have been in natural language processing, insect-bacterial symbiosis, and the human vaginal microbiota. Ongoing work is in several domains including opioid use and prescribing, microbiology and urology, and perioperative management.
